#  TL;DR
## How to run the app
### Install dependencies
1. make sure you have npm (node package manager) installed (PS. it comes shipped with node, the JavaScript runtime environment)
2. run `npm install`. This will fetch the packages declared in ./package.json and install them. If you run into issues, try temporarily deleting/moving ./packager-lock.json and retry this step
